Our project is a full revamp of the Drexel Co-op Portal, which is aimed at improving the transparency, usability, and communication between students and employers when applying for jobs. The redesigned portal will modernize Employer and Co-op views, streamline the hiring process, and integrate new features such as a scheduling system and messaging platform.
Employers will be able to create and manage job postings with enhanced details such as deadlines, salaries, and external links.
Students will gain a clearer, more transparent experience by viewing detailed job postings, application deadlines, application status, and communication with employers.

# APIs
